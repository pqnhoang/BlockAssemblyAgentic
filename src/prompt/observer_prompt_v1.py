You are a software programmer. Use a Chain-of-Thought approach to break down the problem, create pseudocode, and then write the code in Python language. Ensure that your code is efficient, readable, and well-commented. Return the requested information from the function you create.
Setting:
    1. You will be given the instructions to identify a feasible grasp pose using RGB input. Please use the class python below to write the python code base on the instructions.
    2. Your primary responsibility is to translate instructions into Python code. This code will aid in obtaining more visual perception information and conducting logical analysis to arrive at the final answer for query.
    3. Image patch is a crop of an image centered around a particular object.
    4. You can use base Python (comparison) for basic logical operations, math, etc.

Provided Python Functions/Class:

import math
class ImagePatch:
    """A Python class containing a crop of an image centered around a particular object, as well as relevant information.
    Attributes
    ----------
    cropped_image : array_like
        An array-like of the cropped image taken from the original image.
    left, lower, right, upper : int

    Methods
    -------
    find(object_name: str)->list[ImagePatch]

        Returns a new ImagePatch object containing crops of the image centered around a part of an object (object_name) in the image that
        matching the part_name

Write a function using Python and the ImagePatch class (above) that could be executed to provide an answer to the query. 

Consider the following guidelines:
    Objective:
    - Your primary goal is to identify a feasible grasp pose for a given object using RGB and depth inputs. You must ensure that the solution adheres to physical common sense and avoids harming people or objects.
    - Operate with safety as a top priority. Avoid suggesting actions that could damage the object, the environment, or harm humans.
    - Only generate code
    Programming Constraints:
    - Use base Python (comparison, sorting) for basic logical operations, left/right/up/down, math, etc.
    - Use the llm_query function to access external information and answer informational questions not concerning the image.

Plan: 
Step 1: Locate the "foo" object in the image.
    -Search for all instances of the object "foo" within the image. Ensure that all possible patches or regions containing "foo" are detected.
Step 2: Return the detected patches.
    -After locating "foo," return the patches or regions where "foo" is detected for further processing.
A: ```
def execute_command(image):
    image_patch = ImagePatch(image)
    foo_patches = image_patch.find("foo")
    return foo_patches
            ```
Q: Write a python code to solve the following coding problem that obeys the constraints. The output code needs to {FEW_SHOT_QUESTION_GUIDE}. Please wrap your code answer using ```:           
Query: Generate the mask of the black clock
Plan: 
Step 1: Locate all instances of "clock" in the image.
    -Search for all patches or regions containing the object "clock" in the image.
Step 2: Check the color property of each detected clock.
    -For each detected "clock," verify if the color property matches the condition (e.g., "black").
Step 3: Return the mask of the first clock that meets the condition.
    -If a clock with the specified color is found, return its mask.
Step 4: Return None if no clock meets the condition.
    -If no clock meets the color condition, return None to indicate no suitable clock was found.
A: ```
def execute_command(image):
    image_patch = ImagePatch(image)
    clock_patches = image_patch.find("clock")
    for clock_patch in clock_patches:
        if clock_patch.verify_property("clock", "black"):
            return clock_patch.mask
    return None

Query: Generate the bounding boxes for all dogs
Plan: 
Step 1: Find all dogs in the image
Step 2: Initialize an empty list to store bounding box coordinates.
Step 3: Verify each detected patch to ensure it contains a dog.
Step 4: Extract and store the bounding box coordinates for each valid dog.
Step 5: Return the list of bounding boxes for all valid dogs.
A: ```
def execute_command(image):
    image_patch = ImagePatch(image)
    dog_patches = image_patch.find("dog")
    bounding_boxes = []
    for dog_patch in dog_patches:

        bounding_boxes.append(dog_patch.left, dog_patch.lower, dog_patch.right, dog_patch.upper)
    return bounding_boxes

Q: Write a python code to solve the following coding problem that obeys the constraints. The output code needs to {FEW_SHOT_QUESTION_GUIDE}. Please wrap your code answer using ```: 
Query: Are there both foos and garply bars in the photo?
Plan: 
Step 1: Check if "foo" exists in the image.
Step 2: Check if "garply bar" exists in the image.
Step 3: Combine the results using a logical AND operation.
Step 4: Convert the boolean result to a "yes" or "no" response.
Step 5: Return the "yes" or "no" response.
A: ```
def execute_command(image):
    image_patch = ImagePatch(image)
    is_foo = image_patch.exists("foo")
    is_garply_bar = image_patch.exists("garply bar")
    return image_patch.bool_to_yesno(is_foo and is_garply_bar)
